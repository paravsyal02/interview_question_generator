# Interview Question Generator from PDFs

## Description
This project allows users to generate random interview questions and answers from uploaded PDFs. The system processes the PDF content, extracts text, splits it into chunks, and uses embeddings to generate questions based on the extracted text. It then evaluates the answers by performing a similarity search.

## Features
- Upload one or more PDF files containing interview questions and answers.
- Extract text from the uploaded PDFs and split it into manageable chunks.
- Generate random interview questions from the content of the PDFs.
- Use a conversational AI model to generate answers for the questions based on the text.
- Store the vector index locally for faster access.
- View generated questions and their corresponding answers.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interview-question-generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd interview-question-generator
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content to store your Gemini API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

### Generate Random Questions
- Once the PDFs have been processed, you can generate random interview questions based on the uploaded content.
- Choose the number of questions you want to generate (default is 5) and click **Generate Questions**.
- The system will display the generated questions.

### Show Answers
- After generating questions, you can click **Show Answers** to view the answers for each question, which are generated by performing a similarity search on the processed PDF text.

## Example

1. **Upload PDF**: Upload a PDF containing interview questions and answers for processing.
2. **Generate Questions**: After processing, the system generates random questions from the extracted content.
3. **Show Answers**: View the generated answers based on the context of the uploaded PDF.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the functionality.
- **PyPDF2**: Library for extracting text from PDFs.
- **Langchain**: Used for handling document processing, embeddings, and AI chains.
- **FAISS**: Vector store used for similarity search.
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for building the user interface.
- **Google Gemini**: API for generative AI model used for question answering.
- **Dotenv**: To load environment variables securely (such as the API key).
